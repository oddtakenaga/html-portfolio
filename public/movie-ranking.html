    <h1>The Best Movies According to Audrey</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
    
    <hr />

    <h3>Coraline</h3>
    <p>This is a childhood favorite of mine, and I know almost all the lines by heart. The amazing voice acting, peculiar and slightly spooky story line, and the stop motion all culminate into a great, unforgettable film.</p>

    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>I recently watched this in Japanese, and it honestly was such a heartwarming and beautiful movie. The culture was evident through it.</p>

    <h3>The Martian</h3>
    <p>In addition to the charismatic Matt Damon, the story of the Martian includes tension and keeps you glued to your seat while entertained.</p>
